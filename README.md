# wagtail-art

A blog and art gallery Django web app made by Eduardo Salinas that uses the Wagtail framework. This is a personal portfolio project.

## Notes

### Wagtail AI and the requirements.txt file

The requirements.txt file doesn't include the Wagtail AI package because Wagtail AI only runs in Python 3.11 and over, but the requirements.txt file made to deploy the web app in hosting servers that use Python 3.9. So, if you end up deploying my web app into a hosting server, you won't be able to use the ChatGPT API in my Wagtail web app.

If you want to test the Wagtail AI feature, please install the web app locally in a Windows machine using the requirements found in the requirements_windows.txt file. This file works with Python versions 3.11 and over, and runs the ChatGPT API on my Wagtail app.

## Legal Information

### Copyright Information

Most of the code in this web app was taken from Wagtail's official documentation and tutorials, which can be found [here](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/getting_started/index.html).

### Use of ChatGPT

Part of the code in this project was generated in part using an artificial intelligence called ChatGPT, OpenAI's large-scale language generation model. When generating the initial language, the text was reviewed, edited, and modified to our liking, and we assume final responsibility for the content of this code. We did not use an application to generate this citation other than the ChatGPT web application. We copied the text from the ChatGPT chat, pasted it into a text editor, and then edited it. ChatGPT can be found at the following link: https://chat.openai.com

### Bing AI's Chat Disclaimer

Part of the code in this project was generated using Microsoft Bing's artificial intelligence, a search and cloud services platform developed by Microsoft. By conducting searches and accessing relevant information, we utilized the services provided by Microsoft Bing to obtain necessary results and data for the development of this project. While we have carefully reviewed and selected the obtained information, we are responsible for the interpretation and final use of the data in this project. We did not use any other external application or tool to generate this reference besides the services provided by Microsoft Bing. Bing can be found at this link: https://www.bing.com/
